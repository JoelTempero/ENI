    fullDescription: 'ENI Manufacturing contributed to Christchurch\'s post-earthquake reconstruction by designing and fabricating modern transit shelters. The initiative involved blending historic design with modern manufacturing techniques to enhance public transport infrastructure. The structures feature complex enclosed seating areas requiring sophisticated engineering and assembly expertise. Rather than full galvanization, the team implemented zinc-arc spraying to achieve comparable protective properties while improving project efficiency. Component design was modified from welded to bolted connections, streamlining transportation and on-site assembly.',

    fullDescription: 'ENI Manufacturing partnered with Hierarchy Group to revitalize a deteriorated pool facility. The team created an undulating aluminium facade with intricate perforations, powder-coated to capture the essence of the Central Otago sunset. The design features louvre screens providing solar protection and privacy for pool users. The architectural concept includes a large floating roof structure that folds over the building, with screened sides for ventilation and security. The facility now serves as a community recreational asset reflecting the region\'s landscape.',

    fullDescription: 'ENI Facades collaborated with Dominion Constructors to create an advanced facade solution for the College of Engineering building. The team handled site measurement, design documentation, manufacturing, and on-site installation. The facade functions as a sunshade while permitting natural light penetration into the structure. Innovative thinking was essential to determine the optimal manufacturing method for the components. The project employed adjustable brackets rather than custom-fabricated ones, demonstrating commitment to practical innovation. Powder coating protected the metalwork while maintaining a contemporary aesthetic. Dominion Constructors achieved finalist status in the 2018 NZ Building Industry Awards for this project.',
