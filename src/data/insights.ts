      'ENI Engineering highlights New Zealand\'s emergence as a global leader in energy transformation. The nation has established an objective to reach 100% renewable electricity generation by 2030, leveraging geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar resources. ENI reports working with energy sector businesses and launching renewable power generation projects.',
      'The company manufactured New Zealand\'s first locally-produced combiner box for solar installations. Previously, solar farms required imports with extended lead times and bulk ordering requirements. ENI developed a standardised aluminium combiner box that operators can customize with electrical components specific to their operations.',

      'ENI employs a modular system for shelter construction, partnering with local councils to create adaptable designs for various sizes and locations. This approach reduces resource consumption and manufacturing timelines while facilitating straightforward refurbishment processes later.',
      'With refurbishment, there is a significant reduction in waste as much of the existing material can be recycled and repurposed, reducing the need for new materials.',
      'Schools, universities, parks, and municipal areas can repurpose shelters as study spaces, taxi stands, or community gathering spots.',
      'The company assesses each structure individually, determining what modifications suit its location—whether adding benches, accommodating plantings, or installing recreational elements.',

      '"The important thing about outsourcing is that it becomes a very powerful tool to leverage talent, improve productivity, and reduce work cycles." – Azim Premji',
      'Contract manufacturing represents a powerful outsourcing approach. Businesses partner with specialist manufacturers through formal agreements to produce components or complete products, ranging from single parts to fully assembled items.',
      'ENI describes their "from-crate-to-carton" offering, delivering services spanning design concepts through product shipping. In New Zealand, the term historically referred to circuit boards and electronics; it now encompasses metal fabrication companies like ENI producing repeatable metal products.',
      'Cost Management – Predictable per-unit pricing eliminates equipment maintenance costs and depreciation. Lower labor expenses result from accessing specialized expertise rather than hiring in-house teams.',
      'Access to Know-How and Innovation – Partnering provides extensive metalwork knowledge, prototyping expertise, engineering capabilities, and logistics management.',
      'Health & Safety – The manufacturer assumes all workplace safety responsibilities and risks.',
      'Lower Risk – Components meet agreed specifications; you receive exactly what you ordered without penalty for out-of-spec work.',
      'Flexibility – No minimum or maximum quantities required; production scales according to demand without purchasing new equipment or hiring permanent staff.',
